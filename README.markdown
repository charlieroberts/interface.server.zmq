Interface.Server.0MQ
====================

This module is used to send / receive OMQ messages inside Interface.Server.

To use it, make sure you have `0MQ` declared as a transport inside the Interface.Server config file and have the module installed. Once these two steps are completed, 0MQ should be a valid transport option for the server.
